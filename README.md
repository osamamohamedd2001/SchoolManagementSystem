 🎓 School Management System using Linked List 🏫

I am excited to share a project I recently worked on: a School Management System with Queue data structure implemented using a Linked List in the C programming language.

📚 Overview:
This School Management System aims to efficiently manage student data within an educational institution. It allows users to perform various operations, including adding new students, deleting students, editing student details, listing all students, searching for a student by ID, inputting student scores, calculating the average score, ranking students by their scores, and sorting students by their names.

📝 Implementation Details:
The system is designed using a Linked List data structure, which enables efficient dynamic memory allocation and management of student records. Each student is represented by a struct containing essential information such as Student ID, Name, Date of Birth, Address, Phone Number, and Computer Science Score.

🔧 Features:
1. *Add New Student:* Users can enter student details, and a new student record is appended to the linked list.
2. *Delete Student:* The system allows removing a student by searching for their unique Student ID.
3. *List All Students:* It displays all student records in a tabular format for easy visibility.
4. *Edit Student Details:* Users can modify student information like Name, Date of Birth, Address, Phone Number, and Computer Science Score.
5. *Rank Students:* Students are ranked based on their Computer Science scores in descending order.
6. *Input Student Score:* Users can input the Computer Science score for a specific student by providing their ID.
7. *Search Student:* The system enables searching for a student by their unique ID.
8. *Calculate Average Score:* It calculates the average Computer Science score of all students in the system.
9. *Sort Students by Name:* Students can be sorted in ascending order based on their names.

💻 Technical Insights:
The project demonstrates solid programming practices, efficient memory handling using dynamic allocation, and the versatility of the Linked List data structure for managing records. The ranking and sorting algorithms (bubble sort) offer simplicity, suitable for smaller datasets, and can be further optimized for larger datasets.

🚀 Takeaway:
Developing this School Management System using a Linked List allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms. The project showcased my ability to create practical and efficient solutions to real-world problems using C programming.

I'm proud of this achievement, and I'm eager to continue honing my coding skills and exploring more advanced data structures in my future projects.
